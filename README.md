Summer research project led by [Paul Ruvolo](https://github.com/paulruvolo).

Our goal is to combine a convolutional neural network with an efficient lifelong learning algorithm and use the result on a mobile robot. We aim to avoid the problem of catastrophic interference/forgetting that tends to affect incremental task learners through some model manipulation; this repository hosts the results of all of our experiments.
