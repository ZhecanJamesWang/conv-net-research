Summer research project led by [Paul Ruvolo](https://github.com/paulruvolo).

Our goal is to combine a convolutional neural network with an efficient lifelong learning algorithm and use the result on a mobile robot. We aim to avoid the problem of catastrophic interference/forgetting that tends to affect incremental task learners through some model manipulation; this repository hosts the results of all of our experiments. You can view our progress presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FVTXkHN1k1-Kilzq52GJzSHt2neuh8RQ-Hp71P5e4Nw/).
