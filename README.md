# conv-net-ella

Summer research project led by [Paul Ruvolo](https://github.com/paulruvolo).

Our goal is to combine a convolutional neural network with an efficient lifelong learning algorithm and use the result on a mobile robot.

The team:
* [Joey Maalouf](https://github.com/joeylmaalouf) - Conv Net
* [Sean Carter](https://github.com/seanccarter) - Modern Net
* [Zhecan Wang](https://github.com/ZhecanJamesWang) - ROS
