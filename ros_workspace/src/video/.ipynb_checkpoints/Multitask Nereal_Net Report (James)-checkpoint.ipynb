      "As a new task appears the model will increase a new neural network refered to that. The new neural network will initilize its weights from the weights of the previous net. Also besides taking its own new task training data, the new net will take 80% of the training data from the previous one, 80% from the two before, 60% from the three before and so on. By mingling the training data, the most updated net will cover the trainning range from the previous. When the model makes prediction, it will use combine the prediction from the most current net and also some of the previous nets. There are several prediction combination methods of the model. "
